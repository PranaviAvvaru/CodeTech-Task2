2. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and provides weather information in a clear and organized manner.
3. Dynamic Visuals: Implement dynamic backgrounds and icons that reflect the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
4. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

# Key Activities

1. City Search Functionality: Users can search for the weather in any city by typing the city name into a search field.
2. Weather Data Display: Display real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions.
3. Dynamic Backgrounds: Change the background image of the app based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
4. Error Handling: Provide user feedback for incorrect or invalid city searches.
5. Responsive Design: Ensure the application looks good and functions well on all devices, with a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
6. Local Storage (Optional): Store the last searched city in local storage to display the weather data for that city upon reopening the app.

# Technologies Used

1. HTML:
   - Provides the basic structure of the app, including input fields, buttons, and sections to display weather data.

2. CSS:
   - Styles the app to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.
   - Utilizes dynamic backgrounds and icons to represent different weather conditions.
   - Implements responsive design principles to ensure the app looks good on all devices.

3. JavaScript:
   - Handles the logic for fetching weather data from a weather API based on user input.
   - Uses the DOM API to dynamically update the HTML content with real-time weather information.
   - Implements error handling to provide feedback for invalid searches.
   - Manages local storage to save the last searched city (if implemented).

4. Weather API:
   - A third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) is used to fetch real-time weather data based on the city name input by the user.

5. Font Awesome:
   - Used for including icons that represent different weather conditions.

6. Images/SVGs:
   - Utilized for dynamic backgrounds that change based on the current weather conditions.

# Summary

The Weather App is a responsive, user-friendly application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the world. Built using core web technologies, the app features dynamic visuals that enhance the user experience by reflecting current weather conditions. The use of a third-party weather API ensures accurate and up-to-date information, while the responsive design guarantees a seamless experience across all devices.
